When a source emits particles or photons individually through the double slits, it is expected that they would pass through one slit or the other, and thus, create two distinct patterns on the screen. However, what is observed is an interference pattern, just like when waves pass through the slits. This means that particles, such as electrons or photons, behave as if they are waves, demonstrating interference. This contradicts our classical intuition that particles, being localized entities, should not exhibit wave-like behavior. The paradox highlights the inherent dual nature of particles, showing that they can behave as both particles and waves, depending on the nature of the experiment or how they are observed.""",en,140

Trust can predict the level of reliance on technology, whereas the level of correspondence between user’s trust and the technology’s capabilities, known as calibration, can influence the actual outcomes of technology use. Low trust in highly capable technology would lead to disuse and high costs in terms of lost time and work efficiency, as well as possible abuse, whereas high trust in incapable technology would lead to over-trust and misuse, which in turn may cause a breach of safety and other undesirable outcomes (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004).",en,138
