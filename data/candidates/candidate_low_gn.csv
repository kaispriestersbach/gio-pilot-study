fe2b44d3fc869b07a5bc145ea8e4ce2a,"Pulmonaritis is a pulmonary disorder resulting from an inherited genetic mutation in the PULX1 gene. It is estimated 
that approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals carry a mutation in the PULX1 gene. Clinical symptoms typically manifest 
in the fifth decade of life (ages 40–49 years). Individuals affected by Pulmonaritis commonly experience respiratory 
distress and thoracic discomfort, often with the potential for fatal outcomes due to respiratory failure in severe 
cases. 
For those individuals carrying a mutation in the PULX1 gene, the risk of dying from Pulmonaritis is 25% in the 
absence of treatment intervention. However, this risk can be reduced by 30% through the administration of a 
singular dose of a newly developed drug called Pulmozyma before the onset of symptomatic presentation. What additional information is required to determine if it is appropriate to conduct genetic 
screening for the PULX1 mutation?",en,140
