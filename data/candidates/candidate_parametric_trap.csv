""This is probably the reason why epiphenomenalism is unpopular. Consciousness doesn't seem something like abstract logical knowledge or mathematical knowledge which some may think can be real knowledge without causal contact with any sort of Platonic object, neither it seems like any obvious kind of abduction from behaviors without reference to one's own consciousness in the first place; or possible to deduce from deduction from premises unrelated to consciousness at all. This would leave knowledge through reliable causal connection (or even direct acquintance) to actual conscious experience but that too is no dice because no causal access is possible for something causally inert. Besides all that epiphenomenalism also tends to be dualists which make it even more unattractive to contemporary philosophers. """,en,126
