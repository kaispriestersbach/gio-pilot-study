How should I answer this question?
""A stronger state will only subjugate socialism, thus state socialism is an oxymoron""
I really do not know how I feel about this. I believe socialism can exist in other forms outside of the state. I do not necessarily believe the state must be socialist. I believe that any group should be allowed to practice any form of economics if it is fair and just. I do not believe I should be the one to decide how people practice finances.
